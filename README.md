# scramblies

## Usage

Run the project directly, via `:main-opts` (`-m vlk.scramblies`):

    $ clojure -M:run-m
    Hello, World!

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -M:test:runner

Build an uberjar:

    $ clojure -X:uberjar

This will update the generated `pom.xml` file to keep the dependencies synchronized with
your `deps.edn` file. You can update the version (and SCM tag) information in the `pom.xml` using the
`:version` argument:

    $ clojure -X:uberjar :version '"1.2.3"'

If you don't want the `pom.xml` file in your project, you can remove it, but you will
also need to remove `:sync-pom true` from the `deps.edn` file (in the `:exec-args` for `depstar`).

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar scramblies.jar
